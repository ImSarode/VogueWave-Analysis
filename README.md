# VogueWave Analysis

## Description

The VogueWave Dashboard is a Tableau-based project that visualizes and analyzes supply chain data for a Fashion and Beauty startup (Kaggle Dataset). The dataset focuses on makeup products and includes insights into pricing, shipping costs, customer demographics, and supplier performance. The project also involves Excel Solver analysis to minimize transportation costs from source to destination.

## Dataset Features
The dataset focuses on the supply chain of makeup products and contains the following columns:

- **Product Type**: Categories of products, such as Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare.
- **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: Unique identifier for each product in the inventory.
- **Price**: The retail price of each product.
- **Availability**: Indicates whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
- **Number of Products Sold**: Total quantity of each product sold during the specified period.
- **Revenue Generated**: Total revenue earned from the sale of each product.
- **Customer Demographics**: Information about the customers, such as gender (Male, Female, Non-binary, Unknown).
- **Stock Levels**: Current inventory levels for each product.
- **Lead Times**: Time taken to replenish stock from suppliers.
- **Order Quantities**: Quantity of products ordered from suppliers.
- **Shipping Times**: Time taken to ship products to customers.
- **Shipping Carriers**: Names of the logistics companies used for shipping.
- **Shipping Costs**: Costs incurred for shipping products to customers.
- **Supplier Name**: Name of the supplier providing the product.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the supplier.
- **Lead Time**: Time taken by suppliers to deliver products.
- **Production Volumes**: Quantity of products manufactured by suppliers.
- **Manufacturing Lead Time**: Time taken to produce the products.
- **Manufacturing Costs**: Costs associated with manufacturing the products.
- **Inspection Results**: Results of quality inspections (e.g., Pass/Fail).
- **Defect Rates**: Percentage of defective products in each batch.
- **Transportation Modes**: Modes of transportation used (e.g., Air, Road, Rail, Sea).
- **Routes**: Specific transportation routes used for delivery.
- **Costs**: Total costs incurred for transportation.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard provides the following key insights:

- **Product Pricing**: Box plots show the range of product prices for Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare categories.
- **Shipping Costs**: A histogram displays the distribution of shipping costs, helping identify the most frequent cost ranges.
- **Lead Time Analysis**: A heatmap highlights the average lead times for different transportation modes and routes, aiding in route optimization.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Bar charts analyze revenue generated by customer demographics (Female, Male, Non-binary, Unknown) and product types.
- **Supplier Performance**: Metrics like defect rates for each supplier provide insights into supplier reliability.

## Excel Solver Analysis

In addition to the Tableau dashboard, Excel Solver was used to optimize transportation costs. The analysis determines the minimum cost required to transport products from the source to the destination, providing actionable recommendations for cost-effective logistics.
